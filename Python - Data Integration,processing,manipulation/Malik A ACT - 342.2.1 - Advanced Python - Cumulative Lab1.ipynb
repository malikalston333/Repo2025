    "Accessing a Paginated API Endpoint to Explore Data\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "This lab aims to reinforce data manipulation and API interaction concepts using the Star Wars API. You'll work with paginated data, practice data extraction, and perform analysis on character attributes. In this lab, we will combine concepts that we have learned throughout the class so far. Some of those concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Libraries: You'll import necessary libraries like requests and json to handle API requests and JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping and Data Structures: You'll employ loops to iterate through paginated API responses and extract data from nested lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Interaction: You'll make requests to the Star Wars API endpoint and handle the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Definition: You'll define functions to perform specific tasks, enhancing code reusability and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON Data Handling: You'll work with JSON data extracted from API responses, accessing and utilizing character attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: You'll implement error handling to manage potential API request or data processing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: The lab utilizes the Star Wars API.\n",
