    "SBA Overview:\n",
    "This assignment assesses data integration, processing, and manipulation skills using Python. The task is to write a Python program to filter medical records from a given API based on a doctor's name and diagnosis ID and then find the minimum and maximum body temperatures in those filtered records. The program should use the HTTP GET method to retrieve paginated data, handle exceptions, and avoid using the Pandas library. The output should be the integer parts of the minimum and maximum body temperatures found.\n",
